WIZR is a video app that is designed to help you share knowledge with other users. By logging in to your account and selecting something you want to learn and something you want to teach, you can get paired with another user who's needs match yours and be placed into a video chat with them.

## Project overview

The WIZR frontend has been scaffolded using React and Vite. All of our components and contexts can be found in the src file.

When running the project locally, please run `npm install` first to make sure that all of the app's dependencies are accessible. To run the frontend, use `npm run dev`. The minimum node version requirement for this project is v23.11.0.
